## Explanation of the Issue
### What is Express Development Mode?
Express is a popular web framework for Node.js. When running in development mode (`NODE_ENV=development`), Express applications provide detailed error messages and stack traces when exceptions occur. These detailed error messages are intended to aid developers during the development process.

### Why is This a Vulnerability?
Running an Express application in development mode in a production environment can expose sensitive information, such as internal file paths, source code snippets, and stack traces. This information can be used by attackers to identify vulnerabilities and exploit them.

### The Exploit
1. **Detection of Express**:
    - The script first checks if the `X-Powered-By` header contains `Express`. This header is commonly sent by Express applications unless explicitly removed.

2. **Triggering a Detailed Error Message**:
    - If Express is detected, the script sends a malformed request (in this case, sending a single character `t` with `Content-Type: application/json`). This is designed to trigger a syntax error in the JSON parser.
    - In development mode, Express will return a detailed error message including the stack trace.

3. **Interpreting the Results**:
    - If the response status code is `400` (Bad Request) and the response body contains a syntax error message, it indicates that the application is running in development mode.

### Impact
By exposing detailed error messages, attackers can gain insights into the internal workings of the application. This can lead to the discovery of further vulnerabilities, such as:
- **Information Disclosure**: Revealing internal file paths and code can help attackers craft more targeted attacks.
- **Identification of Vulnerable Code**: Stack traces can indicate which parts of the code are being executed, helping attackers to pinpoint potential weaknesses.

## Remediation
Configure the Express application to run in production mode by setting the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to `production`. Ensure that detailed error messages are not exposed to end-users in the production environment.

## Proof of Concept
The provided Python script successfully identifies the use of Express in development mode and demonstrates the vulnerability by displaying a detailed error message.
